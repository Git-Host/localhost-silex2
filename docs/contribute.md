Here is how to help and become a [Silex contributor](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/blob/master/contributors.md).

##Host an instance of Silex

We have more and more people using the online version of Silex. Here you will find [instructions to install Silex](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex) on a server you own or on a node.js hosting. If you do so, and you feel like maintaining your server over the years, Silex Labs will help you advertise your Silex instance and attract people.

##Let the world know about Silex

**Share Silex with the ones you love**. If someone you have informed about Silex releases a website, claim your free t-shirt :)

**Get the word out**. When you talk about Silex in public, let us know and we will send you stickers!

**Organize your Event**. Are you active in your local web design community? Whether you're hosting a local Silex meetup, or demoing what Silex can do, let us know how we can help.

**Write articles and blog posts**. Do not hesitate to draft a blog post and email it through, if we like it we will publish it on Silex Labs blog. Alternatively self publish on your own blog and bump us and we will help promote it.

##Share knowledge

**Answer questions**. Hunt down people [questions being asked about Silex on github](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/issues?labels=question&state=open) and provide a clear answer to their question.

**Create tutorials**. Create text or video guides and upload them to your favorite video sharing website. We have an [official channel]() and a [blog section for Silex tutorials](), where we can add your creations if you like!

**Create marketing tools**. Create some marketing material such as memes from the 90s, put it online and send it through to us and we will spam it about on social media and other places.

##Help improve Silex code

**Write Tests**. We are looking forward to build a QA team. Look at [the existing functional tests](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/tree/master/test/functional) and search through the issues and wiki for outstanding issues to reproduce with tests.

**Improve security**. Install Silex locally - [instructions provided here](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex) and attack it, patch and submit a pull request with a fix then let us know before going public.

##Contribute code and design

It gives you a chance to be helpful to the community and to gain credibility as a person who knows Silex, which is great for building client relationships. After several contributions, you will be added to [Silex contributors page](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/blob/master/contributors.md).

**Give the community a [free template](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/issues?labels=template&state=open)**. Show off your creative skills, or just release an unsold work with a creative commons license. Let us know, we will help you distribute it and advertize it.

**Give the community a [free widget](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/issues?labels=widget&state=open)**. Show off your programming skills, build a widget and release it as open source. Let us know, we will help you distribute it and advertize it.

**Contribute code**. We are open to contributions to the Silex code. If you find a bug or want to contribute a functionnality, [fork Silex source code](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/), make changes and then make [a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Please respect the comments and style of the rest of the code, and do not forget to add tests for each added functionality, see [the existing functional tests](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/tree/master/test/functional).
